replaced slinky replacing singles ai cheap either triple price please note since noticed tunes faster tighter range elixir strings.so must say 'm summarily unimpressed far elixir electric strings.what

man hands 34 made guitar 34 guitar callouses lust couple 1.5- 2k guitars one soon come home frankly love playing guitar never life set little rig next couch always always ready go play 'm watching football baseball play 'm watching news play 'm playing crazy 8 son play morning noon night 'm actually getting not-that-bad playing either lots playing/practice seems inevitably make better hint finger exercises work .so exaggerating reiterate headline little amp changed life better .best buy 100 made since bought son strider balance bike orange orange micro crush amp lives name little bitty third size roland micro cube plenty loud surprisingly loud really amazing much sound comes thing course bells whistles micro cube basically got clean channel overdrive channel tuner volume knob tone knob drive gives good sound like run pedals anyway missing reverb would like far deal breaker.i issues build quality feels solid rock course size trademark orange color make look like toy definitely capable little amp definitely keeper surprised sound amp produces build quality top notch tuner right overdrive seems fine 'm overdrive player.cons far none expect any.i 'm satisfied performance cm-2 tweaking could emulate sound get fulltone ocd 'd say versatile two seperate controls low high frequencies unlike pedals tone '' control toggle switch lets choose classic '' modified '' setting tweaker delight level '' knob lot juice set 10 11 o'clock plenty loud enough although ca use clean boost gives little gain even set gain '' knob zero single coil may sound like tube amp breaking humbuckers much gain stack cm-2 pedals dusted old boss ds-1 run along cm-2 able get good tones ds-1 usually hurts ears cm-2 behind sweet hardwire cm-2 may exotic boutique offerings klon zvex lovepedal get job done significantly lower cost well built take pounding gigging musician subject may others better cost twice price twice good try ca go wrong update full comparison cm-2 fulltone ocd joyo crunch distortion.gain joyo obviously gain followed closely cm-2 ocd 3rd.mix cm-2 amount control separate high low controls followed ocd tone control joyo crunch less sounds matter position put tone control since cm-2 widest tone range make behave like treble booster nuance ocd cleans well roll volume control guitar dynamic cm-2 close second joyo crunch strictly distortion pedal far behind.first like distortion pedals instead making fender blues deville 410 sound distorted make sound like amplifying distorted pedal difference think get it.second like lot pedals play rock/country band play music sounds like neil young tom petty ccr etc simple clean rock roll mix 1,4,5 chords occasional minor 6th want overdrive digitech bad monkey arion tuner need distortion covers ac/dc hendrix etc deville hendrix turn 7. course loud based criteria digitech cm-2 perfect classic overdrive '' setting allows sound like hendrix rocking neil young rock band 60s 70s modern setting allows sound like 80s 90s rock e.g. guns n roses soundgarden.and important settings make amp sound like overdriven sounds like tubes pushed breaking point sounds fricken awesome sound like amplified pedal.so use bad monkey reviewed amazon want read boosting clean sound use cm-2 want play dirtier covers two pedals plus tuner play everything want 'm happy.if 're anything like know 're thinking digitech= digital fake-sounding junk anymore digitech hardwire cm-2 finishes digitech began bad monkey great overdrive pedal right cm-2 offers tone quality compares best market pedal maniac owned wayyyy many overdrive distortion pedals humility know 'm talking flexibility rivaled none market anything close price.what makes cm-2 great like several reviews mentioned another tube-screamer clone distinct mid-range hump slightly rolled bass tubescreamers particularly ts-9 known lot range knobs level add serious boost bass treble knobs allow significantly change tone 're dial never completely transparent cm-2 gain tap overdrive pedals go basically clean boost adding surprising amount saturation tone lastly classic vs. modified switch gives option adding gain bass switching classic modified.i tested cm-2 overdrive clean channel fender hotrod deville front-end boost bugera 1990 basically marshall jcm 900 cm-2 sounds great applications clean channel fender sounds full smooth even turned way overdrive never sounded grainy '' fuzzy maintained warmed organic tube-like boutique-esque '' would characterize great blues playing 'm sure playing tone knobs could dial good country tones well.however use front-end boost already-overdriven bugera amp front lead channel cm-2 serves take tone hard-rock crunch territory metal tone chunky bass roaring highs make palm-muted riffs sound home coming peavey 6505.as conclusion 'm really pleased quality digitech cm-2 sound build quality top-notch price similar less quality overdrive pedals market highly recommend checking cm-2.this one pedal ca without sculpt guitar tone hits amp key getting tight rhythm tone high gain encounter amp tight enough high gain distortion sound good turn gain use lower gain channel hit hard pedal sounds much better internal high gain distortion.alright things might want know buy gain knob turned zero still produces overdrive ca use *clean* boost pedal high output humbuckers still get mild tube-like overdrive zero gain advertised clean boost pedal much gain distortion pedal 're going clean channel amp plenty classic rock blues enough metal though crank gain high knob way barely get prog style metal tone distortion pedal overdrive thing uses tiny smc components circuitry therefore really moddable unlike bad monkey additional mixer cabinet emulated output like tube screamer boosts mids reduces bass going mushy sounding tube channel get tighter distorted sound anyone nice warm amp gets pedal thinking 'll get may disappointed need instead transparent clean boost pedal keeps guitar tone louder volume classic/modified switch pretty cool two guitars one kind bassy scooped sounding bright middy well using switch make one come equivalent needed keeps adjusting amp time switch guitars classic slightly lower gain mid-boosted sound quite tight think peavey 6505 eq structure modified scooped saturated think mesa eq structure switch useful little bonus eats batteries sucking around 150 9v 300 mah rechargeable lasts 1.5-2 hrs swear blue led bright would probably get extra hour instead getting adapter got 8-battery aa clip 9v battery clip 12v dc plug 8 sanyo eneloop batteries hooked negative tip positive sleeve 16,000 mah monster 100 hours play time.this pedal perfect get advertised rugged looks good found noisy unless something wrong guitar strings grounded bridge etc someone mentioned silver tops dials falling decals looked knobs seem like one solid piece me.another thing found instead using overdrive plugin daw use real overdrive pedal front interface magically makes hum noise pickups go away.overall yes highly recommend would suggest people check hardwire metal distortion want something standalone rather overdrive crunchy amp like others though ca stop playing great purchase especially bought used.the cm-2 magnificent 1 produces beautiful overdrive one destroy guitar tone 2 independent high '' low '' tone controls controls extremely sensitive even minor changes -- thus allowing great versatility tone-manipulation 3 features switch allows pick classic '' overdrive extra blast distortion modified '' 4 case made metal 5 comes cover knobs avoid altering settings depressing pedal pedal give metal '' distortion consider digitech tl-2 instead produces warm old-time overdriven tone love thing cup /bottle holder fits nicely mic stand holds water adult bottled

user guide novices connecting various types gear guidance best practices etc.but nit -- overall superb value provided computer interfaces happily.i 'll start saying interface 6 months still going strong think anyone especially beginner looking interface definitely consider unit provide 2 channels monitor headphone could decent sound card fed integrated audio.however gripes 2i2 headphone knob feels little flimsy bit give push purely feel '' really hinder performance makes unit feel cheap controls imo knobs switches feel bit unsatisfying rest unit built strongly moving topic knobs level knobs channels could use indicators aesthetics.why 4 stars problem must started happening today never noticed could maybe never noticed anyways shortly engaged 48v phantom power interface started making barely audible high pitched hissing barely audible problem microphone far enough away hope issue show scarlett 2i2 interfaces would think interface produce noise key recording process many home studios hopefully unit defective something common among 2i2's.another thing note direct monitoring feature unit volume levels coming direct monitoring low makes less practical use words saying would essentially turn gain record hotter '' get closer clipping effectively hear clearly though direct monitor nevertheless feature utilized though.so end 4/5 stars packaging interface came minimalistic

well-designed want convenient controls high build quality 'm pleased digital-to-analog conversion great big volume knob another headphone amp switches input line-in microphone pre-amp switch zero-latency monitoring whatever coming headphone amp particular concern use headphones lot poor headphone amp quite problem behringer headphone amp ok. specifically output impedance 50 ohms rule thumb good headphone/amp matching output impedance 1/8 impedance headphones -- hd 595 50 ohms impedance breaking rule get distortions frequency response case mostly meant attenuation bass manufacturers list output impedance possibly embarrassed anyway focusrite one reason trust little output impedance less 10 ohms -- respectable amazing still low would need principle notice improvement bass response headphones plenty extra voltage could drive higher impedance cans necessary anyway good headphone amp check balanced ins outs work well ins accommodates 1/4 trs style xlr light around

attractive well usb cable type b port means replace gets damaged whatever behringer example hard-wired cable king annoying bus-powered actually would fine wall-wart even simple.i really complaints whatsoever hardware.===================== bad =========================the driver thing horrible windows xp clean installation nothing installed except daw software acrobat reader driver mean computer really stripped performance using behringer good latency time playing note hearing speakers 8 ms using behringer really perceptible.unfortunately focusrite driver though technically asio apparently anything like acceptable latency lowest latency could set get sound instead crackles pops 23 ms. level instrument begins sound sluggish laggy difficult least work large latency like that.i ready return device decided last ditch effort install asio4all sort asio driver use absolutely make manufacturer driver perform decent level installed worked output latency tiny 4.3 ms .3 actually output latency really impressive conclude hardware good machine software horrible.unfortunately ca actually uninstall focusrite driver otherwise windows recognize device never even turns -- class compliant unlike behringer two drivers installed one use.the bad news configuration buggy general turn computer try play vst instrument get crackles pops open asio configuration panel increase buffer funny thing matter buffer starts always increase get good sounds start huge buffer -- lots latency -- crackle open increase buffer yet every time turn computer sometimes leave come back crackly increase yet another step talking major bugs here.i decided try ditching asio4all trying make focusrite drivers work -- maybe setting missing trying set buffer size heard sound explosion computer rebooted came back could get good sounds even turned buffer way tried rebooting times still work uninstalled re-installed focusrite software first work install asio4all well sort get sounds half time.i hope getting idea drivers terrible awful monkey could written better driver would give 1 star fact device works well stars align driver recognizes drive allows play guess 'm willing sacrifice convenience stability nice hardware works would never use live situation time critical.the good thing drivers update fix 'm hoping already revised driver amazing even 2.2 driver seriously abomination like 2.1.================ closing thoughts =======================unfortunately really usb interface good driver behringer driver always worked moved interface one usb port longer recognized reinstall driver however use behringer driver asio4all would give 11 ms perform without complications trouble free seen type device.if read presonus audiobox usb m-audio fast track pro probably two closest competitors focusrite get bunch comments like one horrible horrible drivers never get fixed actually mackie makes competitor well onyx blackjack -- reviews show driver possibly even worse one unfortunately none pro music manufacturers cares drivers live unstable systems work half time maybe better mac know.interestingly really usb 2.0 device range quite shocking considering long usb 2.0 standard around real implication usb 1.1 devices like m-audio presonus two channel 24/96 audio time enough throughput usb 1.1.so light competition focusrite looks kind ok. unfortunately audio interface manufacturers -- least range device -- think need good hardware especially good software least hardware one spec cross fingers improved drivers future.bottom line fantastic 5-star device make software work consistently.if tight budget care balanced in/out 'd recommend go behringer uca202 ufo2020 tons cheaper class complaint better drivers use high impedance headphone even headphone amp pretty good one.================ update may 2012 ==============a new version driver 2.3 came since writing new driver actually works stopped using asio4all get decent latency -- often -- inexplicably require edit settings increase buffer percentage time reboot computer change anything time works ok. would never use mission-critical setting i.e. gigging pro work home use good enough

gentlest setting could get almost perfectly tune even capo set softly would fall guitar last thing want happen middle performance planet waves capo contrast even lightest setting still solid grip neck

little closer ear range compared last capo tested might projecting side guitar felt capo squeezes string thing creating tone fret line bridge least two found total differences.i wanted say using

gauge strings say consider important let know 'm conducting experiment 8 gauge strings tele electric 9 gauge acoustic 're running much heavier gauge string lower action would course less tuning shift going could adjust capo round adjusting knob fine-tuning able adjust point pressing beyond level frets really squeezing way fret board therefore less challenge trying keep tune using capo although doubt many setting way rather squeezing fret board instead although possible heavy gauge strings fine tune pressure sufficiently yield tuned instrument load heavier gauge strings creating strong enough grip finer setting wo slide guitar like shubb lighter setting.of course predicated upon re-tuning guitar change capo position really way create perfectly tuned instrument little tweaking change capo position 'm sure people ignore consider ever slightly tune instrument something objectionable impede overall quality performance find hand guitar perfectly tune takes music level possible matter

evenly balanced bending strumming fretting picking plucking slapping '' .i ca really speak claims tell darn good strings sound great feel great recommend highly.i 'm certainly musician family honestly know nothing guitar strings got husband aficionado guitar player family said excellent quality strings happy product come highly recommended someone uttered swear word two inferior strings past highly

musician coated strings might better choice difference somebody plays two three hours every day wear set strings long corrosion sets somebody plays hour two twice week likely never wear strings corrosion becomes bigger problem.the big question balanced tension worth little extra money seems like yes strings slightly easier bend feel little bit better huge difference direct comparison string

tension string requires different amount compensation bridge means changing setup- easily done telecaster changing length b changes length e well higher tension new b require compensation since 'll

're going like 're rythm player long gigs tuning stability big warm sound mean d'addario strings like kias string world make cheap products cost lot less last lot less time strings ok always partial nickel wound particularly semi-flatwound digress typical strings elixirs 'm used lasting long time case strings sound good like nickel strings last long started sounding dull lifeless stopped keeping

admit okay bought 1966 telecaster brand new back still love lot different guitars mostly electric 4 acoustics electrics love extra light 8 gauge strings 5 us fly things pace lot difficult heavier gauge strings anyhow digress reason light gauge strings subject tuning problems big fat frets like .050 34 found gibons esp-ltd squeeze string fret light gauge strings easy squeeze way fret board x-large jumbo frets quite distance making guitar go tune cure using heavier gauge strings 10 makes possible determine quite easily top fret without full squeeze way fret board capo work 10 lot tension strings lot capos create comfortable fit fully fretting strings without going sharp note zone.so since use lighter gauge strings even 9 subject limitation hard time finding capo would sit comfortably top range fret board still squeeze string sufficiently create buzz without making string sharp guess found several capos none make grade light gauge strings except one honest surprised worked.okay put test used snark headstock tuner great little tuner know secret using peterson hd tuner bench model fodder another post one tenth one cent tuning accuracy okay back explanation.with snark tune open string line stays center without wavering one side problem headstock tuner seen superbly accurate peterson headstock tuner sent back acting crazy anyhow secret using snark like best headstock tuners tried tune open string first fret string let say 5th fret occasionally find string open position registers tune even though may little sharp little flat strum whole chord get desire tune ears hear order get spot nothing beautiful perfectly tuned guitar nothing worse one well tune.so tuning open string tuning fretted string tune right open position chance tiny bit sharp enough register tuner fret string example 5th fret naturally stretches string little bit making sharper show snark note sharp balance open string fretted string really wonderfully tuned instrument even need hear audience listening tune yet get right sweet spot love know well.so said fully understand d'addario ns artist capo cat 8217 meow first tuner ever used kept guitar perfectly tune clamping neck adjustable like others one sensitive light gauge strings well often see artists trimming tuning putting capo one even light gauge strings must admit surprised taking right wrapper going tuning procedure get guitar spot immediately job right even little bit sharp.to super critical another tip using capo put closer fret rather middle two frets reason stretches string less tension resistance steeper angle right alongside fret rather farther way like middle two frets get tiny bit sharpness positioned two frets 8 gauge strings since two important factors comfortable use getting way playing open chords keeping guitar tune best way use capo simply clamp strings right second fret example rather right third one right third one gives perfect tune like right second one keeps capo way way matter fact accustomed using capo position know finger chords sometimes make mistake fret one lower belong little practice even looking guitar instantly corrects say quite simply say use capo farther away hand slide right fret rather right fret it.so capo job perfectly light easy clamp course accurately handle 8 breeze anything thicker box set lightest setting perfect 8 telecaster tried teles strats really neck different head stocks work both.so guess ca recommend capo high enough since one works perfectly super light gauge strings problem sure remember guitar case switch using different guitar might get another one backup.i completely agree 34 jpfromoh 34 .this planet waves d'addario artist capo tries many things winds none perfectly.the micro-adjusting knob tweaking tension/pressure nice wound mess

sound particular guitars case 'm happy sound hard time giving solid five-star rating.i tried two separate guitars play regularly terribly impressed sound either one vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar normally excellent tone crisp clear fairly loud strings softened tone looking sound okay nowhere near good martin sps use really bring best guitar.i cutaway electric/acoustic use sing fairly quiet softer tones drown voice strings made guitar even quiet considerable drop-off tone quality well might cheap old strings could tell anything special particular guitar spectacular sound begin strings nothing improve like strings either sound good strings improve tone pull guitar strings neither however sound great instrument plugged amp.based upon experimentation would guess great sounding guitar 're fanatic slight drops tonal quality 'll love way strings feel play rate excellent category tone 80 equation 'd play wire-wrapped rope sounded better regular strings tonal category strings fell

uncharted strings buying comments reviewers tone coated strings noticeably duller intrigued promise long life though taylor big baby bought used came set nanowebs probably year- sound like old strings review set gave chance finally see sound new.i 'd changed strings 1970s gibson gospel week ago decided would reference nanowebs went 1970s guild d-35 well broken solid spruce top guitars gospel bit
